The conference was organized by Prof KS Kannan from Jain University, Bangalore and was inspired by Rajiv Malhotra’s book 'The Battle for Sanskrit' which was a purva-paksha of the entire body of work of Prof Sheldon Pollock at Columbia University, NYC. The conference was essentially a uttar-paksha or a rebuttal of specific papers of Pollock which was chosen by the organizers. This podcast contains audios onwards from the first conference.\n\nTopics: Swadeshi Indology Conference, Rajiv Malhotra, Sheldon Pollock, Prof KS Kannan\n\nFor original source please visit https://rajivmalhotra.com/ and https://swadeshiindology.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/RajivMalhotra.Official/ \nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk85J3pqkn1y--k2wNMbthA\n\n- Rajiv Malhotra Volunteers.",
